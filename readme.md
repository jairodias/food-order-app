# React Application README

## Description

This is a React application showcasing various concepts such as Context API, states, useEffect, createPortal, refs, and proxies.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18.18.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/sua-aplicacao.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Concepts Covered

### Context API

The Context API is used for sharing data between components without having to explicitly pass props through each level of the component tree.

### States

States are used to manage component-specific data that may change over time. They allow components to update and re-render based on user interactions or other triggers.

### useEffect

The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It can be used for tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

### createPortal

createPortal is a method in React that allows rendering a child component into a different part of the DOM tree, outside of its parent component.

### refs

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. They are typically used to interact with the DOM imperatively.

### Proxies

Proxies are a feature of JavaScript that allows you to intercept and customize operations performed on objects, such as property access, assignment, invocation, etc. They can be used for various purposes, including data validation, logging, and more.
